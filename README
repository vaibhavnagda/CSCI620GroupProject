Setting up the system:
    Visualize the attributes:
    The script is written in Python 3.5 and will require pandas and numplot libraries.
    To run the script, create a directory with 'DATA_TABLES' add all the csv data tables to it.
    Run the visualise_data.py file to view the data.

    Import the mwb file to get the database with current data and set up into MySQL Workbench.
    This should also create a user, but you may need to add a user.
        To do this in MySQL Workbench:
            Select Users and Privileges.
            Select Add an account.
            The application runs with a static user and password (not the most secure, but this is what we are working with for now.)  Create the account with username as java and password as password.
        To do this via commandline (from MySQL shell):
            USE mental_health;
            CREATE USER 'java'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mental_health.* To 'java'@'localhost';
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES

    The database should then be fully set up.
    There is also a little set up regarding the Java application:
        Dependencies need to be added. Using IntelliJ this can be done relatively easily.
        Under Project Structure, select Modules and then select Dependencies. Here you can add the jar files for jxbrowser: jxbrowser-6.17.jar, jxbrowser-linux64-6.17.jar, jxbrowser-mac-6.17.jar, jxbrowser-win32-6.17.jar, and license.jar.
        Make sure that MySQL is also included by including the bin file as a Library by going to the Libraries tab and selecting the + to add another library.

        This should be all of the set up that is needed for the application.
        Note: if the browser has an issue finding the mentalhealth.html for browser.loadURL, you can change this to "file:/..." where ... is the complete path to the html page in this project.

    From here, you should be able to run the application!
